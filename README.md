Mission Statement:
Of all the natural hazards/disasters that Canada faces, floods are the most frequent. A flood could result in damage to property, cause power outages, make transportation challenging, and pose a danger to you and your loved ones.

We want to make sure you are prepared, and have the information you need at your fingertips the moment you need it. We know where the safe spaces in your area are, and can help you to get to them quickly in the event of a major flood. Our app is powered by Canadian open data and Esri technology, to give you the best possible experience when time is of the essence. Locate the nearest hospitals, and find the best route to get you there.
